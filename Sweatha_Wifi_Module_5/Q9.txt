Fast BSS transition :
It is used to reduce the time taken for client to move from 
one basic service set to another during switching bt AP's-
It is done by avoiding security , QOS process after 
disconnecting from one AP and then doing these process to 
connect to another ap-
so here before the client reconnects with new AP the 
security and QOS process will be done when it is with the 
old AP itself to make faster transmission-
So there will be more faster transactions-
Ft reduces the shifting dead time during roaming-
The data will not get dropped anywhere and no pause in 
data transmission-
Used in mostly hospitals,universities etc
