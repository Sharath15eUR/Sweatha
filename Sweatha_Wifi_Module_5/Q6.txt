WIFI 7
Bandwidth is doubled from wifi 6which is 160 mhz in wifi 6 changed to 320 ,hz in wifi 7-
It increases the data amount in each symbol by using 4k QAM , symbol represents the specific 
pattern of amplitude and phase in the constellation diagram where the symbols are plotted as 
points -
Multi link operation is introduced in wifi 7 which enables user to send data in multiple 
bandwidth at the same time -
By using mlo we can send data through various BW according to the type of data -
For eg , if it is a video it can be given to higher bw , if we are sending larger files then it should 
be sent in the highest BW of all-
So it reduces sending all data in a single bw there by lessing congestion , data loss -
Even if the bw is in usage part of it which is free can be used to transfer data which reduce 
congestion in dense areas-
Multiple resource units allows devices to use multiple frequency at same time during 
transmission-
RU is the smaller parts in the freq available so we can assign each part of freq separately to 
user -
So in prev wifi each device gets one RU only , but in wifi 7 each device can use multiple RU's at 
same time -
So if the freq are having interferemce or noise still we can assign the parts which are clean
