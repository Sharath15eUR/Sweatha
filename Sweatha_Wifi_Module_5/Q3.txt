TWT in wifi 6 -IoT
Here the sender and receiver will sign a negotiate when and how they have to wake up to 
transmit data -
In IOT we may have a situation where we have to deal with large data , high power consuming 
devices ,sensors etc which may consume huge power-
So when we use TWT in iot we can save a lot of power and only the device wakes up at 
scheduled times-
Ans each device has a scheduled time to access the medium avoiding congestion-
We can manage both trafiic levels high , low-
We can use any no.of devices when we use TWT In iot to preserve the powers-
For eg : we can use twt in agriculture sensors to like periodically send data about soil 
conditions, humdity ,weather etc
