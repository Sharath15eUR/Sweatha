WIFI 6 
OFDMA
--it allows simultaneous data transmission for like many devices same time which 
improves efficiency 
-QAM --increased bit per symbol and supports high throughput 

-MU-MIMO --wifi 5 supported MU -MIMO in only the downlink which is from ap to user but 
here we have it for both uplinka nd downlink-

TWT --scheduling the time to save power -
Increased Capacity and low latency --useful in crowded areas 

-WIFI 6E
Here the width is increased to 6GHZ for channels

-The overlapping and congestion are reduced here

-There will be low latency and high speed due to high bandwidth-

WIFI 7

Here the BW is doubled from wifi 6 (320 mhz)

-The data rate is also increased
-And here we have MLO(multi link operation)which enables devices to send and receive data 
across multiple channels at same time
-The latency is very much reduced
