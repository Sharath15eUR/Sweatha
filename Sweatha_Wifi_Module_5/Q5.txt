WIFI 6 VS WIFI 6E
WIFI 6 WIFI 6E
It uses 2.4ghz and 5 ghz It uses 6ghz bandwidth
Comparatively slower data speed and 
lower capacity than 6EHere due to wider channel there will be high data speed 
and higher capacity 
Can support other backward compatible 
devices tooCannot support other backward compatible devices  , 
only supports 6ghz band devices
More interference and congestion 
compared to 6ELow interfernce and low congestion due to high 
bandwidth
Possibility to high latency but it can 
cover longer rangeLow latency due to wider channels but covers shorter 
range
