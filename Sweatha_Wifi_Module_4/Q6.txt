4 WAY HANDSHAKE:

EAPOL (Extensible authentication protocol over lan)
This handshake is the main in providing security for wifi 
-There will be exchange of 4 msgs bt the client and access point to generate some encrypted 
keys which can be used to send the data in actual transmission
-The 4 steps:

Msg 1 ---AP will send a random number which is anonce and unicast it to the client and 
client will derive the ptk( pairwise transient key -used to encrypt unicast traffic bt client 
and ap)

Msg 2 --client will send the snonce(random number generated by client) along with 
mic(msg integrity card) to the ap to generate the same ptk

Msg 3 --ap will genrate gtk(global translucent key -used to encrypt all the broadcast & 
multicast traffic ) and send it along with the generated ptk and mic , this is unicasted to 
the client

Msg 4 --last msg was sent by client  to ap which unicast the key confirmation with mic 
 On the whole at end we will have ptk , gtk in client side and ptk in ap side
