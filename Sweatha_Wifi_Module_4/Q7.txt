POWER SAVING METHODS :
Saving power is main in wireless n/w since we are using battery-
TYPES:
LEGACY --
here the client will go sleep and wake periodically
When client sleeps , the ap will buffer the data frames and send it when client 
wakes up and search for beacon or poll frame is sent from them
This cant be used for complex applications
U-APSD (unscheduled automatic power saving delivery)
Here the client makes a sudden awake if any qos services come and it is done 
using prioritizing traffic by service period
And it responds with a buffer of data from ap to client when it is not qos related 
during sleep
Used mainly for voip , voice calls
TWT(target value time):
Both client and ap will sign a negotiate for specific periodic sleep and wake 
schedules 
It makes all the deivces to wake up simultaneously which is the main part in IoT for 
broadcasting this TWT
This is the most efficient methods for complex applications especially in IoT
