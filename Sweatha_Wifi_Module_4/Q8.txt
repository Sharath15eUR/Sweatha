MAC methodology:
In Mac every device share the common physical medium so , we should avoid collision by 
using any access methodology-
Main methods are ,
CSMA/CA --collision avoidance , so the device should check before talk . If busy , device 
has to wait random time
RTS/CTS(request to send , clear to send) --to solve the problems in sending the data and 
granting the confirmation
DCF (distributed coordination function) --here the carrier is sensed both physical and 
virtual so that we can get positive ack
PCF(point coordination function): --ap itself will act as the point coordinator to control 
the data 
EDCA (enhanced distributed channel access) --This provides priority over the services like 
prioritizing voice , video data over others
