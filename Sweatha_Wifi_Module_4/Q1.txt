MAC LAYER :

-it is a sublayer of data link layer in the open systems interconnect model

-among the 7 layers , mac is presented above the physical layer and below the Logical link 
control layer which is the next sub layer in Data link layer

-MAC and LLC layer makes the  data link layer in osi model

-It usually controls the access to the physical medium of devices in the network

-So by controlling the access , it prevents collision like more than one device communicating 
with the medium at same time that can cause interference

-Each device is assigned mac address at this layer to identify the device

-Mac layer creates data  frames which is then passed to the physical layer and to the wireless 
medium

-It also helps in error detection (crc),flow control , retransmissions of data when ACK  is not 
received properly

-in wifi , mac layer is responsible for security because of the unique mac address and headers 

-It enables QoS for voicd and file data-1st
