SCANNING :
It is the method where client devices discover the ap points to connect in the wireless 
environment
TYPES:
ACTIVE :
Client will send active probe req in the channel and waits for probe res from ap's 
with its capabilities
The info is then recorded by client and helps in fast discovery
But high power req, and increase the traffic
PASSIVE :
Here the ap's will broadcast a beacon frame which is periodically sent for a client 
to discover that
So client have to get into channels and listen for a beacon in that channel to 
connect  to ap's
But it is a slower process of discovery since client has to move to subsequent 
channles if no beacons was found
But no traffic and less power req
