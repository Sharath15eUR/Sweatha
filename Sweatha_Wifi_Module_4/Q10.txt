MSDU 
-MAC service data unit :
It Is the payload data that is sent from higher layers from the user and passed down to mac 
layer to get formatted-

MPDU 
-MAC protocol data unit:
It is the complete frame including msdu and used to be sent to phy layer alogn with mac 
headers-

AMSDU(aggregated):
Multiple msdu are joined to single mpdu in mac layer-
To reduce overhead and crc check-
Here single crc for the aggregation-

AMPDU:
Aggregating multiple mpdu's at the phy layer-
Each mpdu has own crc and more realible, damaged packets can be sent individually  during 
retransmission-

AMSDU IN AMPDU:
Amsdu can be plced inside a ampdu-
So we can have single error checking feature and large aggreagation at the same time
