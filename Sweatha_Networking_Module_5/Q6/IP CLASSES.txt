1)10.1.1.1

CLASS :
This belongs to class A since the first bit in ip is 10 which falls bt 1 to 126 ie for the class A

SUBNET MASK:
255.0.0.0/8 - first octet is fixed for the n/w address , and other 3 will be used for host networks

VALID IP RANGE :
10.0.0.0 - n/w addr
10.255.255.255 - broadcast addr
10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254 -valid ip address range

TOTAL ip addr = 2^24-2 since first 8 bits will be used for n/w addr and remaning 24 will be for host addr.
subtracting 2 for n/w and broadcast addr.


2)172.16.5.10

CLASS :
This belongs to class B since the first bit in ip is 172 which falls bt 128 to 191 ie for the class B

SUBNET MASK:
255.255.0.0/16 - first two octets are fixed for the n/w address , and other 2 will be used for host networks

VALID IP RANGE :
172.16.0.0 - n/w addr
172.16.255.255 - broadcast addr
172.16.0.1 to 172.16.255.254 -valid ip address range

TOTAL ip addr = 2^16-2 since first 16 bits will be used for n/w addr and remaning 16 will be for host addr.
subtracting 2 for n/w and broadcast addr.

3)192.168.1.5

CLASS :
This belongs to class C since the first bit in ip is 192 which falls bt 192 to 223 ie for the class C

SUBNET MASK:
255.255.255.0/24 - first 3 octets are fixed for the n/w address , and other 1 will be used for host networks

VALID IP RANGE :
192.168.1.0 - n/w addr
192.168.1.255 - broadcast addr
192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 -valid ip address range

TOTAL ip addr = 2^8-2 since first 24 bits will be used for n/w addr and remaning 8 will be for host addr.
subtracting 2 for n/w and broadcast addr.


CONCEPTS I HAVE LEARNED IN STUDYING THIS :

IP addresses are classified into 5 classes A, B, C, D and E. So A, B, C will be used most
popularly for the large networks and B for the medium size and C for the small networks.
But D and E will be used for the multicast purpose and experimental purpose.
So in class A, if the first target will be fixed, so in binary we will say that first
bit is fixed which is 0 - 00000001 to 01111110
So first starting bit will be the 0 and starting from 1, we are going to have the number ranging
from 1 to 126.So the 8 bits it is for the network which is fixed 1, the other remaining 24 bits,
so totally we will be having 32 bits, so other 24 bits will be used for the host networks.
So the default subnet mask will be 225.0.0.0, so which is first will be the fixed 1 and
the number of host addresses will be range from 2 power 24 and we will minus 2 from 2
power 24.Because we have to allocate one for the network and one for the broadcast address.


So in class B, we will have the two bits fixed in binary that is 10, other bits will
be 0 and when we want to display the ending address, we will change all the zeros apart
from the first two bit as 1-10000000 to 10111111 So the IP, so the numbers range from 128 to 191 when we convert the binary into a decimal
1 in class B.So 16 bits will be used for the network since two octets are fixed and the remaining 16
from the 32 bits will be the 16, so the remaining 16 will be used for the host network and the
default subnet mask will be 255.255.0.0 which means the first two octets are fixed here.
So here 2 power 16 is the host address, number of host address and we have to minus 2 for
the network and broadcast.


In class C, the first three bits will be filled in the binary which is 110 and the other
bits will be 0 - 11000000 and for the end address, end range we have to convert all the zeros other
than the first three bits to 1 -11011111 and when we convert this binary to decimal, it will have
the numbers from 192 to 223.
So all the numbers including these will be the class C and first 24 bits will be used
for the network and the remaining 8 bits for the host and the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0
and the host address, number of host address will be 2 power 8 and we have to minus 2 for
the network and the broadcast address.
So if you want to find any IP address which is like which it belongs to which class and
their subnet mask and their network range of IP address, we have to find the first octet
is belongs to what class and then we have to frame the network address, broadcast address
and the valid IP range of the network.
