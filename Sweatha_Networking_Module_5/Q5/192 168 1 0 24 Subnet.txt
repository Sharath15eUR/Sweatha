192.168.1.0/24  
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
- Total IP Addresses: 
  - /24 means there are 32 – 24 = 8 bits left for hosts  
  - Total addresses = 2⁸ = 256  
  - Valid host addresses = 256 – 2 (network & broadcast) = 254

Divide into 4 Subnets

- 4 = 2², we need to borrow 2 bits from the host.


- Borrow 2 bits →/24 + 2 = /26



- /26 means 26 bits are used for the network portion.
- The new subnet mask 
  - Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 
- New Subnet Mask:255.255.255.192


- Number of host bits = 32 – 26 = 6 bits  
- Total addresses per subnet = 2⁶ = 64  
- Valid host addresses = 64 – 2 = 62



 Subnet Ranges

A /26 network means the subnets will increase in increments of 64 addresses.  


Subnet 1:
- n/w- 192.168.1.0  
- broadcast addr -192.168.1.63  
-  Host Range- 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.62

Subnet 2:
- network Address- 192.168.1.64  
- Broadcast Address-192.168.1.127  
- Host Range- 192.168.1.65 to 192.168.1.126

Subnet 3:
- Network Address- 192.168.1.128  
- Broadcast Address- 192.168.1.191  
-  Host Range- 192.168.1.129 to 192.168.1.190

Subnet 4
- Network Address- 192.168.1.192  
- broadcast Addr- 192.168.1.255  
- Host Range-192.168.1.193 to 192.168.1.254



## 4. Assign IP Addresses in Cisco Packet Tracer

### A. Configure the Router

For proper routing between subnets, you’ll need a router with multiple interfaces (or subinterfaces) to act as the gateway for each subnet.

Assume you have a router with four FastEthernet interfaces:  
1. **Interface Fa0/0 (Subnet 1):**
   - IP: 192.168.1.1  
   - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192

2. **Interface Fa0/1 (Subnet 2):**
   - IP: 192.168.1.65  
   - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192

3. **Interface Fa0/2 (Subnet 3):**
   - IP: 192.168.1.129  
   - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192

4. **Interface Fa0/3 (Subnet 4):**
   - IP: 192.168.1.193  
   - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192

#### Example Router CLI Commands:
```plaintext
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
! Configure Subnet 1 interface
Router(config)# interface fa0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.192
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# exit
! Configure Subnet 2 interface
Router(config)# interface fa0/1
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.65 255.255.255.192
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# exit
! Configure Subnet 3 interface
Router(config)# interface fa0/2
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.129 255.255.255.192
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# exit
! Configure Subnet 4 interface
Router(config)# interface fa0/3
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.193 255.255.255.192
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# exit
```

### B. Configure the End Devices (PCs)

Assign IP addresses to PCs from each subnet. Also, set the default gateway of each PC to the IP address of the router interface for that subnet.

For example:
- **PC in Subnet 1:**
  - IP Address: 192.168.1.10 (any valid host between .1 and .62)
  - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
  - Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

- **PC in Subnet 2:**
  - IP Address: 192.168.1.70 (any valid host between .65 and .126)
  - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
  - Default Gateway: 192.168.1.65

- **PC in Subnet 3:**
  - IP Address: 192.168.1.134 (any valid host between .129 and .190)
  - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
  - Default Gateway: 192.168.1.129

- **PC in Subnet 4:**
  - IP Address: 192.168.1.198 (any valid host between .193 and .254)
  - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
  - Default Gateway: 192.168.1.193

### C. Connect the Devices

- Use appropriate cables (copper straight-through) to connect each PC to a switch.  
- Connect the switch to the router.

---

## 5. Verify Connectivity Using Ping

### A. From a PC in one subnet, try pinging:
- The default gateway for that subnet (to verify local connectivity).  
- A PC in another subnet (to verify that routing is working).

### B. Example:
- On a PC in Subnet 1 (say IP 192.168.1.10), open the command prompt and type:
  ```plaintext
  ping 192.168.1.1  (should succeed – local gateway)
  ping 192.168.1.70 (a PC in Subnet 2; this should succeed if the router routes correctly)
  ping 192.168.1.134 (a PC in Subnet 3)
  ping 192.168.1.198 (a PC in Subnet 4)
  ```

### C. Troubleshooting:
- **If pings fail:**
  - Verify that each PC’s IP configuration (IP, Subnet Mask, Gateway) is correctly set.
  - Check that router interfaces are in the “no shutdown” state.
  - Confirm that the router has a routing table entry for each directly connected subnet (this should happen automatically if interfaces are configured).

## 6. Summary

- **Original Network:** 192.168.1.0/24 (254 hosts)
- **Divide into 4 Subnets:**  
  - Borrow 2 bits → New subnet size: /26  
  - New Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192  
  - Hosts per subnet: 62 valid hosts  
- **Subnets Breakdown:**
  - **Subnet 1:** 192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.63 (Valid: .1–.62)
  - **Subnet 2:** 192.168.1.64 – 192.168.1.127 (Valid: .65–.126)
  - **Subnet 3:** 192.168.1.128 – 192.168.1.191 (Valid: .129–.190)
  - **Subnet 4:** 192.168.1.192 – 192.168.1.255 (Valid: .193–.254)
- **Setup in Packet Tracer:**
  - Configure router interfaces with the gateway IPs for each subnet.
  - Assign PCs an IP from the valid range of each subnet and set the corresponding default gateway.
- **Verify:** Use ping between devices in different subnets to ensure that the router routes packets correctly.

By following these detailed steps, you can divide the 192.168.1.0/24 network into 4 subnets, assign IP addresses manually, and verify connectivity in Cisco Packet Tracer. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
