192.168.1.0/24  
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
- Total IP Addresses: 
  - /24 means there are 32 – 24 = 8 bits left for hosts  
  - Total addresses = 2⁸ = 256  
  - Valid host addresses = 256 – 2 (network & broadcast) = 254

Divide into 4 Subnets

- 4 = 2², we need to borrow 2 bits from the host.


- Borrow 2 bits →/24 + 2 = /26



- /26 means 26 bits are used for the network portion.
- The new subnet mask 
  - Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 
- New Subnet Mask:255.255.255.192


- Number of host bits = 32 – 26 = 6 bits  
- Total addresses per subnet = 2⁶ = 64  
- Valid host addresses = 64 – 2 = 62



 Subnet Ranges

A /26 network means the subnets will increase in increments of 64 addresses.  


Subnet 1:
- n/w- 192.168.1.0  
- broadcast addr -192.168.1.63  
-  Host Range- 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.62

Subnet 2:
- network Address- 192.168.1.64  
- Broadcast Address-192.168.1.127  
- Host Range- 192.168.1.65 to 192.168.1.126

Subnet 3:
- Network Address- 192.168.1.128  
- Broadcast Address- 192.168.1.191  
-  Host Range- 192.168.1.129 to 192.168.1.190

Subnet 4
- Network Address- 192.168.1.192  
- broadcast Addr- 192.168.1.255  
- Host Range-192.168.1.193 to 192.168.1.254




 In pckt tracer: 
  - Configure router interfaces with the gateway IPs for each subnet.
  - Assign PCs an IP from the valid range of each subnet and set the corresponding default gateway.
-  Use ping between devices in different subnets to ensure the connection.
