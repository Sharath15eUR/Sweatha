STATIC IP IN CLIENT DEVICES:

Here we have changed the ip of end devices , usually dhcp will be used to configure the ip dynamically . so if we want to change that we can do that using the following steps:

-Go to the network tab in setting and choose the interface or wifi you are connected.
-GO to the IPV4 tab and change the ip configuration from dynamic to static 
-GIve the ip -eg:192.168.1.20,subnet :255.255.255.0,default gateway should be you routers ip , you can get this using ip route cmd .
-Give the DNS ip as 8.8.8.8 (google)
-Apply and reconnect to the interface , now your system should have the ip that  you have configured

HOW TO CHECK THE MODIFIED IP :

-Use 'ip a ' to check the modified ip 
-we can see inet addr as the modified ip
-We can ping the router ip again to check whether the static ip configuration have worked or not
