PINGING EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS USING NAT:

-I have created a small network using two PC's and one switch and one router and to
simulate the public server. 

- I have configured the server IP address as 10.0.0.2 we can configure this with any address but the IP address should be in the same network of the public IP of
the router which we have given as 10.0.0.1 so I have configured the server IP address as
10.0.0.2 

-  first I have got an error stating that we can't ping or  request timeout so I have studied about this and I came to know that we can't use Cisco packet tracer to connect
with external network or the internet so we can't ping the Google server from the Cisco packet tracer so we can communicate only within the network we have built inside the Cisco
packet tracer so we cannot frame the entire ISP or the internet service provider system which we use in real time 

-in the Cisco packet tracer so I just have configured the server with an IP address as the same network of router and also the default gateway of the server
should be the public IP of router to send the reply packets from server to the router's public IP I have configured like that so if we ping from the PC0 the server's IP address
we should be able to get the reply packets in Cisco packet tracer 

-we can't communicate with the server which is not in the network of the router domain so we should be like aware that
we have to use the same network addresses and to capture the packets in the and also we have to configure the NAT which is the network address translation so in the router
CLI we have to give the access list 

-so access list is something that we give the private IP of the router in the access list to add them in the NAT so whichever IP address or
in the access list will be used for the network address translation 

-so we have to add the network
IP private IP network and the wildcard mask to the access list 

-the wildcard mask wildcard mask is nothing but the opposite of the subnet mask

-also we have used the overload to enable the port address translation so we are connecting multiple IPs which is in the access
list to a single public IP with different port combinations so whenever packet is coming to
the router and it is not in the LAN it will check for the public it will route to the public IP
and the public IP will route to the ISP but it will route using the NAT and also it uses a
different port combinations with this and if ISP receives the request and ISP
will transmit it to the Google server or any other server so the reply packet from the Google
server will get in the ISP and ISP will send to the routers public IP 

-so it will differentiate by the port allocation so which private IP sends the request it will have a different port so we
can send the reply packet to that specific port to the public IP and then to the public IP we
can identify which private IP have requested so we can send the packet written 

-after configuring this we can ping the IP address of server from the PC0 and to capture the packets in the
wire shark

-we can simulate ping from the system command prompt Google server ping 8.8.8.8 and
we can analyze the packets in wire shark by using a capture filter ICMP and you can also
use the display filter as the IP source address as your PC source IP address and destination IP
as 8.8.8.8 but in wire shark we are not able to see the after NAT source IP address it will
display only the before NAT source IP address which is your PC's IP 

-so to know the after NAT source IP address we can go and give the command to show mtr 8.8.8.8 giving that command we can
analyze how many hops or what are the IP addresses it has undergone to reach the DNS Google server

-so in this also we cannot see the public IP of router why because it routes the packet from
the private IP and we can only see the Google's public IP next hop of the Google's public IP
like that 

-and if we use the traceroute cmd we can see the public ip of router as the default gateway

-in Cisco packetracer we can see the show IP NAT translations command we can see the source IP address has changed
from the private IP to the public and then the packet has been forwarded to the server
so using this we can analyze and acknowledge the NAT translations and how the source IP is changing
from the private to the public whenever a packet or a packet have come and it has to be forwarded
to the external network we can analyze those things using the Cisco packet racer and wire shark
