NETWORK TOPOLOGY - GNS3 & ETHERNET FRAME ANALYSIS :

-I have used one switch , two pc's from the device list.
-Connect the devices using cables and configure the ip's , default gateway , subnet mask in the ip configuration.
-Ping the devices from the cmd prompt and we can also view the mac address table in the CLI of switch.
-Capture the packets while pinging using wireshark and click stop capturing 
-Analyze the ethernet frame captured :
*The frame number and how many bytes have been captured , frame length etc
*Ethernet type and src , dest mac address will be displayed
*Type of the ip configuration : ipv4 - 0x0800,ipv6-
*Ip address of the src and dets pc and the protocol used like ICMP for ping etc..
*The protocol detailed information will be displayed (Type number will tell the request info like for ping - 8)
*Data field will give details about the bytes captured 
-We can use display filters :
eth.dst=='mac address of dst'--to get the packets only from specific destination
eth.type==0x0800 -- to get only the ipv4 request
ip.addr=='ip of any specific pc'
