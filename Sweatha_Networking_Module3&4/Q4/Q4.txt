TROUBLESHOOTING ETHERNET COMMUNICATION :

-I have used 2 pc's , 2 switch and one router in the packet tracer
-After configuring ip's of pc's and turning the interfaces up in router CLI , try to ping the systems
-If there is any issue in ping use 'tracert' to traceroute the packets like teh path it takes to reach the destination in each hop
-We can also use arp-a to check the arp table to verify the ip's
-In CLI of switch see the interface brief  ip route to check the ips are configured correctly
-I have also attached the screenshot of simulation of the tracert cmd of packets
