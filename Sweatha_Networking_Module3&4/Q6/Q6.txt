TROUBLE SHOOT PING WITH TRACERT :

-I have used 3 pc's and one hub from the devices
-Configure the pc's with ip address and default gateway 
-Ping pc2 from pc1 , if anything goes wrong like if you get any error like req time out , packet loss in the statistics of ping cmd do the following :
*Check the ip of pc2 in cmd of pc2 using 'ipconfig' cmd
*Use tracert cmd in pc1 cmd prompt to check the paths of packets in the system 
*In my case, i have tried ping but i got a req time out error and i have used tracert cmd and from the output i can get the devices that my packets flow in the network 
*If any ip configuration is incorrect , or any traffic issue arises we can't ping the system 
*Using this we can troubleshoot and ping the system again
