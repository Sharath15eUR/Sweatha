STATIC IP :
-I have used cisco packet tracer for the simulation .Two pc's and one router.
-Click the pc and go to the desktop menu and inside that click the ip configuration to assign a static ip ,gateway,subnet mask to the end devices.
-Click the router , go to the CLI and make the interface of two pc's up and write the memory .


MODIFY MAC ADDRESS :
-Click the pc and go to the config tab and choose the interface
-Modify the mac address of the pcs in the field 
-We can view the mac address using IPCONFIG /all cmd 

NETWORK CONNECTIVITY :
-Ping the pc's ip address in the command prompt and and check the reply packets 
-We can also see the interfaces and pc's connected to the router in its CLI using 'show interface brief','show arp' , to see the mapped details of  ips and mac address
