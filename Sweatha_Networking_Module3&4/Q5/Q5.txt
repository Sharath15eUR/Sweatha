LAN TOPOLOGY :
-I have used 2 laptops and one switch in the cisco packet tracer
-Connect the devices using copper straight cable 
-Configure the laptops with ip's and default gateway 
-after configuration ping the laptop with ip's 
-In CLI of switch we can also see the interface , ip route details etc.
