KERNEL CRASH :

-it is a situation where the core of linux os the kernel gets into a panic mode which is not recoverable 
-it redirects to system reboot , freeze or a blank screen more likely without GUI 


CAUSES :

-referencing a NULL pointer
-using m/y after free()
-using a false driver to kernel
-not proper usage of kernel modules
-race condition where multiple kernel threads accessing the data incorrectly


CRASH TYPES :

-kernel Oops -- it is non fatal and can continue after crash and logged in kern.log file inside lib dir

-kernel panic -- it is a fatal error and cannot be recovered so the system has to shutdown or reboot and we will have  black screen withou any GUI 


RECOVERY :

- we can use any crash tools to analyze 
-one such is kdump to capture m/y dump when kernel crashes
