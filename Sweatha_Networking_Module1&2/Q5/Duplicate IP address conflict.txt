Duplicate IP address conflict :
It is a condition where 2 devices have same ip address assigned to them .

Duplicate ip conflicts arise in 2 situations mostly :
1. When two devices are statically (manually) assigned the same ip 
2.When the same ip which is manually assigned is also there in the DHCP pool , so when a device boots and gets the same ip from the pool duplicate ip conflict occurs

WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE SITUATIONS?
1.The devices might have network connectivity issues and the network traffic will get disturbed and the routers will disable one of the devices  
2.The device might have connectivity issues and dhcp server generates an error meanwhile rejecting its request , then the device will request ip continuosly 


HOW CAN WE CHECK IF TEHRE IS A DUPLICATE IP CONFLICT IN OUR SYSTEM ?
->Use arp -a 
If same mac addr is assigned to multiple ip's then there is a conflict
->ifconfig or ip addr show
If you see ip address conflict in the report, then you have to resolve that.
->Use ping
You can manually assign same ip in 2 devices using ifconfig for an interface and then ping that ip from a third device , you will be able to see a conflict


SOLUTION:
->restart the system - when the device boots it request for another ip to dhcp server so the error gets solved
-> manually change the ip address which is same
