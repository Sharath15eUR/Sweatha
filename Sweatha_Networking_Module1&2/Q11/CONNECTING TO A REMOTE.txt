CONNECTING TO A REMOTE MACHINE :

We can connect to remote machines through ssh or telnet . 

SSH (secure shell) :
->It is used to connect to a remote system securely over the internet
->It encrypts our data over the internet so that the privacy of data is ensured
->It uses public key for authentication and it is not easy to decrypt the data in ssh
->It uses the port 22 , but it can be customized
->It is used in modern systems mostly because of it's secured transmission of data to the remote system.
->It prevents the attackers from hacking or spoofing the data during transmission.

HOW TO CONNECT USING SSH : 

->ssh usernae@remote_ip
sweatha@sweatha-HP-Pavilion-Laptop-15-eg2xxx:~$ ssh sweatha@192.168.1.39

->if it runs on df port other than 22 :
ssh -p 222 sweatha@192.168.1.10



Telnet (Telecommunications and  Network ) :
->It is also used to connect to a remote system
->But it does not do any encryption on the data we are transmitting . It is open to public , easily to hack
->No security is provided to the data
->It is an older method of connecting to a remote system
->It runs on port 23


HOW TO CONNECT USING TELNET : 

->telent remote_ip
telnet 192.168.1.39

->if it runs on df port : telent remote_ip port_num
telnet 192.168.1.39 223
