NETWORK INTERFACES :
->ifconfig - used to check both wired and wireless connnections and their parameters

PARAMETERS IN ifconfig :
-flags--status of n/w interface whether it is active and running state and it is able to multicast , their hexadecimal values are added up as flags
-mtu--max transmission unit is the max no.of bytes that can be sent and received through that interface
-inet -- ipv4 addr
-netmask--subnet mask for the ip addr
-broadcast-- broadcast ip addr
-inet6--ipv6 addr
-ether--MAC address of the system
-txqueuelen--Transmission queue length
-RX packets and errors--the status and report of received packets
-TX packets and errors--the status and report of transmitted packets


->iwconfig - used to check wireless connections and their parameters mainly

sweatha@sweatha-HP-Pavilion-Laptop-15-eg2xxx:~$ iwconfig

PARAMETERS IN iwconfig :
-ESSID--name of the wifi that i have connected
-Mode--there are various modes like managed (our laptop is connected to a router),monitor(used while capturing packets) etc
-frequency--freq of the wifi signal
-Access point--gives the MAC addr of the n/w interface
-Bit rate-- speed of the signals 
-Tx-power --transmission power of the wifi 
-Link quality -- signal quality whether high or low
-Signal level -- the strength of signal
