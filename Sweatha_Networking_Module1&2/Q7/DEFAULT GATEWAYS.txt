DEFAULT GATEWAYS :
->Default gateway (router) used to connect the local device to external devices like to access the internet
->Used as an intermediate device for the communication
->It is the Ip addr assigned to the network router 


FINDING DEFAULT GATEWAY :
->ip route show or netstat

sweatha@sweatha-HP-Pavilion-Laptop-15-eg2xxx:~$ netstat -rn (r is for getting the kernel route table and n is for getting the data in numeric value not in text)
Kernel IP routing table

sweatha@sweatha-HP-Pavilion-Laptop-15-eg2xxx:~$ netstat -r
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
default         _gateway        0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 wlp1s0
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 wlp1s0

sweatha@sweatha-HP-Pavilion-Laptop-15-eg2xxx:~$ ip route show ( shows the routing table with ip addr and gateways)
default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlp1s0 proto dhcp src 192.168.1.39 metric 600 
192.168.1.0/24 dev wlp1s0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.39 metric 600 
 
sweatha@sweatha-HP-Pavilion-Laptop-15-eg2xxx:~$ ip route show|grep default| awk '{print $3}' (to fetch the gateway ip addr alone)
192.168.1.1

HOW TO CHECK THE GATEWAY IS REACHABLE :
->Use ping with the default gateway ip that we have fetched in the prev cmd

sweatha@sweatha-HP-Pavilion-Laptop-15-eg2xxx:~$ ping -c 5 192.168.1.1

5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4009ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 2.571/16.371/27.340/10.434 ms

TO RESOLVE THE TIMEOUT ISSUE :
->If you get a timed out error while using ping command you can do the following :
1)Restart the network service - sudo systemctl restart networking
2)Verify whether the gateway ip is correct and you have a proper internet connection
3)Check whether the firewall is blocking any ICMP packets - Do this by disabling firewall -sudo ufw disable

POINTS THAT I HAVE COLLECTED :
->default gateways are used for transmitting the packets that are not sent within the lan 
->It has a Public IP given by ISP to route the packet request to access the external networks
->It uses NAT [Network Address Translator] to transfer the packets from private ip to public ip which is then handled by ISP router and fetch the response back
->In response , again the packets are sent to public ip which is then transfered to private ip by NAT and then default gateway will send the response to laptop
