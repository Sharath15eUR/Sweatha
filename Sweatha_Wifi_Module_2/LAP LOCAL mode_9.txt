LAP-LOCAL mode

-In local mdoe LAP [lightweight AP] send every data to wlc through the CAPWAP

-And it cannot do anything by itself and it depends on WLC for device authetication , data traffic handling , data roaming etc

-when wlc goes down , the conn between ap and wlc will fail since it is connected through the local mode of AP

-and then the devices connected to the ap will get disconnected

-the ap will req for a new wlc by sending a discover messsage

-when the client devices wants to connect again , the ap's can't handle the aunthentication too

-the raoming of data is not doen unless the ap is again connected to the wlc


HOW IT SOLVES THE WLC FAILURE:

-THe LAP will req new WLC for a specific time if no wlc appeared means , it will go to a standalone local mode
-Then the LAP continuously req for new wlc after rebooting , if it founds any wlc it automatically switch to that
-TO solve this problem only , we have studied about the flexconnect mode in AP which works well with or without wlc
