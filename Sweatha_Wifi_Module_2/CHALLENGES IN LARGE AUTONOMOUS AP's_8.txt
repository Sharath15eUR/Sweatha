CHALLENGES IN LARGE AUTONOMOUS AP's:

-INterfernce 
when we have more no.of ap's the traffic may get congested and interfered with another one , which in turn slow the data speed and we can use proper channels to overcome this

-Handling roaming
when user move from one ap to other in university it is difficult to ensure the smooth conn over the devices wihtout any data loss

-Attacks
More no.of ap's will result in more vulnerability to attacks by the hacker , so it is very challenging to secure the n/w

-Position & power
we have to place all the ap's inside the university such that there is no area without wifi and we need such huge power source to provide a large num of ap's. since inadequate power supply will make the ap to fail

-load balancing
very imp one , to balance the laod bt every AP's , if not  properly balanced the speed will be low and some ap's will not used at all

-N/w troubleshoot
the maintanence and troubleshooting will be difficult in a huge num of ap's , and so for fixing any issues by the admin


-Cost
setting up 50 + AP's require a huge investment to provide secured, faster , qos enabled service in the n/w
