Sniffer and monitor mode :


SNIFFER :
-It can capture only the packets from the  devices connected to it 
-In wireless n/w , this mode is limited to only the devices meant to it since the transmision is secured
-It requires the device to get connected to that wifi 
-It cannot capture encrypted data in the transmission since its the device private
-It is mostly used in troubleshooting device conn to the wifi , wifi traffic issues
--Not used in security testing since packets captured are onl limtes to the devices connected
-Wireshark is used here to capture


USECASE:
-To test the app from a device in a n/w 
-to check n/w speed and latency 
-to check whether the device leaks any private data

MONITOR:
-IT is used to capture all the wifi packets in the range given
-It doesn't require the devices to get connected to it , it can capture the packets from not connected devices also 
-It can also capture encyrpted data
-It is suitable for security checking sinceit can capture any packets in air and if any unauthorized packet is there it will indicate
-tools like airmon ng are used in this

USECASE:
-For study purposes in research 
-To analyze the n/w traffic and congestion when like packets count are very huge and capturing them 
-Used mainly in security testing , to check whether there is any hacking , unauthorized packets arrive
