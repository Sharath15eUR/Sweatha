SPLIT MAC :

-Generally, Mac layer is responsible for data transmission, security, encryption and ensuring the quality of service in the Wi-Fi networks.

-But in traditional methods, only the access points are responsible for doing all these in the Mac layer, which will be like a complex one when we have to handle many users or more traffic like that.

-So in split Mac architecture, we have access points and the wireless LAN controller, which is like a centralized device for managing those APs and where APs are responsible for
handling the device connection to the Wi-Fi and  WLC will be responsible for this security and providing the QoS ,roaming to the users.

-Basically, it splits the Mac layer into two main components, one is AP and the other one is wireless LAN controller in the split Mac architecture.
So access point handles the real time connection with the device and Wi-Fi ,the packet the data transmission, retransmission and the response times, etc.

-And WLC it is used for like ensuring the security like authorized user checking and the quality

-And if a user wants to move from one AP to another AP, the AP will request the WLC forthe synchronized movement of data.
so the WLC ensures the seamless transfer between one AP to another AP without losing any disconnection or data of the user.

-In Wi-Fi networks, like if a user wants to connect to the Wi-Fi using a phone or a laptop, the request will be going to the AP.

-And the AP will forward the request to the WLC to handle like if the user is authorized or if there is a secured one transmission like that.

-And the WLC decides whether to allow or block the device upon Wi-Fi in those configurations and the authentication is successful means the WLC will act as a DHCP itself in Wi-Fi
networks and it will assign a private IP to communicate with that Wi-Fi by the device.

-So basically what it does is, it assigns a private IP to the devices which move on to communicate to that particular Wi-Fi network and if the user wants to access any public
internet through that Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi using the network address translation will map the private IP with that public IP of router.

-The WLC itself act as a DHCP server assigning a private IP to the device so that it cancommunicate to that private Wi-Fi network.



How using an AP improves the performance of Wi-Fi networks:

- using the split-mark architecture we can reduce the overall load on AP.
-traditionally it is entirely based on the access points which is not that much profitable
to the user.
- we will be using APs and WLC in split-mark architecture which reduces the load on APs
which improves the data transmission very fast and we can like user rooms from one AP
to another AP.
-WLC manages the seamless connection between them and we can also ensure a more secured function using the split-mark architecture which essentially managed ensuring more consistency and it is very easy for an admin or a network administrator to configure a single WLC we can configure all the APs that is connected to them instead
of like administrating one by one APs in the network.
-So on overall using the split-mark architecture we can reduce the workload on the APs and
make the AP to seamlessly work for the Wi-Fi connectivity of the device and to transmit
the data in a faster manner.
