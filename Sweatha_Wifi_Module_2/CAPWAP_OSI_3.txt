CAPWAP Control and provisioning of wireless access point - OSI 

-The CAPWAP protocol operates at the layer 3, which is the network layer of the OSI model. 
-So why it is belongs to the layer 3?   it sends the data package, the WiFi transmission packets or sent uh as an IP packets. 
-So it encapsulates the data and the control messages inside IP packet and and it sent over through the CAPWAP or any protocol between the AP and the WLC. 
-So basically it functions at the layer 3 and also it it can work on any IP network and and in the WI fi or the wired network 
-it can work in any IP subnets and it can also route the traffic between different VLAN subnets and between different network. 
-Since WiFi is everywhere we can also like route in route between different Vlns using this IP only.

-So it fits in layer 3 and the first tunnel is control tunnel, second one is data tunnel. 

-So the control tunnel is used for only the like management and control of the AP. So basically provides the secure transmission. And when an AP connects to when WLC, the first tunnel which is formed is the control tunnel. So it enables the secure communication between the AP and the WLC. And through this tunnel, only the configuration messages, the secured messages, the A P configuration data will be sent through this tunnel. And the all messages sent through this tunnel will be a secured encrypted one and it is transferred through the data Gram transport layer security protocol to protect those sensitive information inside the tunnel. And some of the examples is like aP when, whenever aP is registering itself first time and the firmware updates that is sent to the A P from the WLC, all these will be sent through the control tunnel. 

-Second one data tunnel, it can be an encrypted or an unencrypted tunnel based on the configuration or the protocol they are using.So basically this tunnel is used for sending the actual user data. That is when when after connecting with the WI Fi, we will be seeing any videos or we will be attending any calls or we will be browsing any data in the website. So all these user data will be sent through the data tunnel. They can be encrypted or unencrypted. So these data are sent from the wireless clients through the AP and to the network. So these data are the , WiFi client data and it forwards those client data to the WLC over this data tunnel and the WLC also routes the data to the client device through this data tunnel. So basically it is used for transferring the datas. Example will be like if you are using a YouTube streaming video or else if you are making a video call or a voice call over the WiFi.
