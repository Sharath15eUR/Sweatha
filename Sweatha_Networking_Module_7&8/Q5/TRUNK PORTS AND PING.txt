TRUNK PORTS AND PING:
-trunk port connections are used to enable the communication bt df vlans
-it can  be done bt switches,bt a switch and a router too
-but both switches have to know about both the vlans 
-I have used 2 pcs and two switches and one router to create trunk ports bt switches and ping 
-configure each switch with the respective vlan and allow both vlans via trunk port interface
-and to enable inter vlan routing like to ping bt them we need a routeror layer 3 switch , i have used router with one of the switch making another trunk port and have configure that using vlan 10,20
-in the router enable the interface and make the sub interface for each vlans with the gateway addr of the n/w
-when we ping from one pc to other the packet will flow like :
pc1->switch1->trunk to switch0->router0->switch 0->pc0(through switch 1)



ERROR I HAVE FACED:
-i am not able to ping , i have tried many times
-and i have discovered that i haven't enabled trunk port bt switch 0 and router 0 with vlan 10, 20
-after enabling them i am able to ping bt df n/w using trunk ports
