ACL - Access control list
-it is used tp control the n/w traffic and can apply rules to filtr the traffic on a specified n/w


TYPES:
1)standard acl:
-can be used to control only based on source portts and not helps us to filter with types of interface , adv filtering in the interface deviceetc 
-1-99 numbers can be used for the access-list

eg:
access-list 10 deny 192.168.1.10 - blocks any req from the given src

2)Extended acl:
-can be used for advanced control and can create rules for specific interface type 
-100-199 numbers are used for access-list

CHECKING THE ACL RULES: 
how we can check whether the restriction is happening because of the acl that we have created ?
-we can use 'show access-lists <number>'--it will show the number of matches this rule have found in the prev execution of testing

eg:
access-list 102 deny tcp any any eq 80 - blocks the http req since port 80 is for http from any src and any dst ip on tcp protocol
- set the access list in the interface stating inbound or outbound direction
IN: the req which is received in to the router
OUT:the req which is going out from the interface
eg:go to the respective interface and give ip access-group 102 in , ip access-group 102 out


Control based on specific ip:
-We can restrict the src with their specific  ip 

eg:access-list 10 deny  192.168.1.10 - it block all the req from the src ip given , this is standard acl
