Types of NAT :

STATIC :
-This is used when the server public ip is not gonna change , it remains static 
-it is easy to configure but practically not effective 

eg:
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.10 10.0.0.1



DYNAMIC :
-it maps the internal n/w ip's to a pool of public ip
-this pool of ip addr is used by an internal n/w temporarily for each session .After the session it again drops it  to the pool .


eg:

ip nat pool PUBLIC_POOL 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.20 netmask 255.255.255.0


access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 - permit the internal private ip to be translated using NAT


ip nat inside source list 1 pool PUBLIC_POOL



PAT (Port address translation):

-this is used when many private ips are connected to a single public ip 
-it is more efficient usage pf public ip and cost effective one 

eg:
ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload - this allows the private ips to use the gig0/1 interface as the public interface
