Management VLAN:
-this type of vlan is usually for the administartive purpose , so that the other n/w are not disturbed
-it is used to configure the n/w devices switch,routers etc to control them from remote side 
-it restricts the access to specific users like admin


HOW I HAVE DONE IT :
-i have assigned a vlan for management and a ip address to it
-and a telnet line for remote log in and a password
-when i connect to the n/w device through pc i  have to give password and then i can access the switch from the remote pc
