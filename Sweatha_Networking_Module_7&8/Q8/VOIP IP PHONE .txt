VOIP IP PHONE 
in IP phone we can send both data and voice
-using separate vlans for data and voice
-high priority should be given to voice and it can be done using
mls qos trust cos- class of service score ranges from 0 to 7 which tells the priority score of voice data
-we can create separate vlans for them in switch and can analyze the vlan configurations
-show vlan brief
-show interface <name> switchport-it tells which vlan is configured for what and teh status also
-show mls qos interface <name>-tells whether the qos is enabled or not

since in cisco pckt tracer we cannot simulate the real ip phone to send data and voice ,, i have connected and configure and checked the status of vlans 


ERROR I HAVE FACED:
-enabling qos failed for me , so i enabled it globally
-mls qos
