Inter vlan routing :

-Vlan is something that is used to logically group devices in the n/w such that it is accessible to the specific group .THey all will be on the same physical n/w but will be divided logically

-it is used to limit the broadcast domain which enhances the privacy of data

-We can use switch to create vlans this is at layer 2 (data link layer)and if we want to route bt these vlans we have to go for layer 3 (n/w),sowe should use either layer 3 switch or router on a stick(using router)

-Here i am using router on a stick

MODES:
1)access mode-to communicate within n/w
2)to communicate bt multiple vlans

-In router , we can create sub interfaces to enable inter vlan communication -0.10,0.20
-We are using IEE 802.1Q stnadard for vlan tagging 
-vlan tag is a 4 byte number to indicate the vlan id in the req
-SO using these we can communicate bt df n/w pc's through switch to frwd the packet along with vlan tag to the router which enables routing bt the df n/w
