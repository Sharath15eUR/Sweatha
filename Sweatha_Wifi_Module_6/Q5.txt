WPA2:
WPA2 was introduced to fix the security problems found in WEP and WPA. -
WEP had very weak encryption, and even WPA (which was like a quick fix) still used the RC4 
algorithm,only dynamic keys  which wasnâ€™t very strong.-
So, to give better protection, WPA2 came with a stronger encryption method called AES 
(Advanced Encryption Standard).-
This made it much harder for attackers to break into Wi-Finetworks.
