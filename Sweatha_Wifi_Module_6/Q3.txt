WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):
This was the first type of Wi -Fi security. It used a key for encryption, but it was very weak and 
easy to hack. So, it is not safe anymore.-
WPA (Wi -Fi Protected Access):
WPA came after WEP to fix its problems. It used TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) for 
better security, but still not strong enough. It was just a temporary improvement of using 
dynamic keys instead of statric single one-
WPA2:
This is much better than WPA. It uses a stronger encryption method called AES (Advanced 
Encryption Standard) and is more secure. It is still widely used today.-
WPA3:
This is the latest and most secure one. It protects even if the Wi -Fi password is weak and adds 
better security for public Wi -Fi. It uses SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) instead of 
the old handshake, which is harder tocrack using any brute force since it eliminates the 
preshared key option
