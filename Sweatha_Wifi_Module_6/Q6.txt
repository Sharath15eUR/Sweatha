PWK in 4way handshake :
The Pairwise Master Key (PMK) is important in the 4 -way handshake because it’s the 
foundation of the security process used to generate the keys that will secure the wireless 
connection between the device  and the access point (AP).-
The PMK is created either from the user’s password (in WPA2/WPA3) or it can come from an 
external server if the network is using something like an enterprise setup (RADIUS server).-
During the 4 -way handshake, the PMK is used by both the AP and the client device to generate 
unique encryption keys for that session. -
These keys keep  data safe while it’s being sent over thenetwork by ensuring both have 
derived same key without passing the key over air
