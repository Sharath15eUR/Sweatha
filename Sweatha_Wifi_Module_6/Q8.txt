If we enter a wrong Wi -Fi password (passphrase), then the client and the access point (router) 
will not be able to create the same Pairwise Master Key (PMK).-
Since the PMK is not the same, the keys used to protect the handshake messages (like PTK) 
will also be different.-
Because of this mismatch, the handshake will fail-
The client won't be able to connect to the Wi -Fi -
The AP will ignore the request and may even temporarily block the device after 
multiple failed attempts of wrong password
