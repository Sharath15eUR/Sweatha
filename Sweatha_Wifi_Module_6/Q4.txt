WEP -Insecure :
WEP is considered insecure mainly because it uses a static encryption key and a weak 
algorithm called RC4.-
The key doesnâ€™t change often, and hackers can easily capture some Wi -Fi packets and crack 
the key using simple tools.-
On the other hand, WPA2 and WPA3 use much stronger encryption. -
WPA2 uses AES, and WPA3 uses SAE for better protection. These are hard to crack even if 
someone tries to guess thepassword.
