AUTHENTICATION:
Authentication means checking if the person or device trying to connect to the Wi -Fi is 
allowed or not. It makes sure only trusted users can join the network. For example, when 
we enter a Wi -Fi password, it is a way of doing authentication.-
Encryption means hiding the data we send over Wi -Fi so that no one else can read it. Even 
if someone captures the data, they can’t understand it because it’s scrambled orcoded.-
Validating who is sending is authentication and protecting the data we send is encryption
