FREQUENCY BANDS DIVIDED FOR WIFI :

1) 2.4 GHZ

-oldest but the most common type of frequency band 
-it provides longer range 
-but data transferred at a slower speed
-It has interference in the signal 
-used in browsing mostly in older devices 
-there are 14 channels in this band (1-14)
-each channel is 5 MHZ apart but each signal has 22 mhz which make some channel overlap with others
-channel 1,6,11 are the non overlapping channels

2) 5 GHZ

-it provides shorter range of communication
-here data is transferred at a faster rate
-here it provides less interference than 2.4 ghz
-here channels range from (36-165)
-used in video streaming , hd calls 
-here the overlapping of channels will be less compared to 2.4 ghz
-here dynamic frequency selection (DFS) is needed to prevent overlapping in some channels here
-dfs is like there will be a specific channel (52) for detecting if there is any radar signal in the band , if it presents we will not transmit the wifi 
-if the band is free and no radar signal is found , the wifi is transmitted through the band 

3)6 GHZ

-it is the band used in latest wifi 6
-the data rate is extremely fast 
-the range is  shorter like inside a same room
- 59 channels can be used here
-no overlapping channels will be here and no old devices can be used
-here the interfernce of signals will be very less
-no DFS is needed here since no overlapping channels will be present here
