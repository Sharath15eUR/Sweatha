PPDU (PHYSICAL LAYER PROTOCOL DATA UNIT):
The basic data unit transmitted over the physical layer-
TYPES :
Legacy -- it has basic preamble and payload ,And use simple OFDM based modulation○
HT PPDU -- it has MIMO feature with HT SIG fields , present in wifi 4○
VHT PPDU -- it had wider channels and has VHT - SIG A and B fields for user counts , in
wifi 5
○
HE PPDU -- supports OFDMA , MU - MIMO , so it can handle multiple users in one
transaction
○
EHT ppdu -- I t provides multi link operation and more wider channels upto 320 Mhz
