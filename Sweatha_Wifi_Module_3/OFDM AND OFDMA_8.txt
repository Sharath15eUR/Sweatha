OFDM AND OFDMA :

OFDM :

-this is used to send the large stream of data into smaller sub streams 
-each sub stream is sent to subcarriers in the lane 
-the subcarries are arrnaged in an orthogonal position which avoids overlapping , interference in the data 
-there won't be any interference here
-but only one user data can be sent here
-all the subcarriers are used by only one user
-no multiuser support , suitable only for downlink that is when a base station server send all the data to particular user at a time 
-there will be high latency since one suer data is sent at a time and low efficiency
-used in wifi 4 ,5  

OFDMA :

-this is an adv version of OFDM adding multiple user access to the technique
-here multiple users can send the data at the same time 
-subcarriers are shared among multiple users
-there will be built in multi user support
-and there will be less latency since data is sent faster of multiple users at same time
-so there will be better efficiency
-used in wifi 6 802.11 ax
