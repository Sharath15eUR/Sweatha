GUARD INTERVALS

-In wlan the data is sent wirelessly .Those data will travel several paths and can face walls , objects and other which make interference ,supress etc 
-It is received like multiple times at the receiver side because of this nature , so this is called as multipath propagation of data
-the data will be overlapped here and this is called inter symbol interfernce
-To avoid this we use Guard intervals there will be a interval between sending one data and other 
-there are 2 types ,in standard guard interval it is 800 ns  used mostly in noisy environments , but it is quite higher 
-and we have to wait 800 ns to send next data till the firstly sent data is settled
-Second type is Short guard interval , which has 400 ns interval and mostly used in cleaner environment with less interference 
-in SGI we can send more data in same time having high data rate

HOW SGI IMPROVES EFFICIENCY :

-it improves the number of data that can be sent at the same time 
- and it is sent faster than std interval
-overall it increases the efficiency by 10 %
-so here the data can be sent faster and proper , but there should be less interference 
-used in wifi 4 ,5 , 6 for higher data rates
