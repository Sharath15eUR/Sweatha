Frame :

the phy layer framer has 3 main components:

1) PREAMBLE :

-it helps the receiver to detect and synchronize with the incoming signal and it has several fields to do this :
	--Short training field STF : it helps in signal detection and give the time for synchronization of data
	--Long training field LTF : used to fine tune the frequency 
	--SIG (signal field) : it provide the info about modulation schemes  and it helps the receiver to know about the rest of frames details
	

2) PHY HEADER :

-it provides data about the decoding part to the receiver .
-it helps the recevier to decrypt the data from the packet received 
-it has fields like modulation schemes , length of payload , service field for preserving the future field space and parity bits for error checking 
-in newer headers it has HT-SIG ,VHT-SIG , HE-SIG fields

3)Data :

-it contains the actual data of the signal
-it has the mpdu (mac protocol data unit) which is processed by the mac layer 
-it also has the service , tailer ,padding bits along with mpdu
-it is encoded and then transmitted further S
