Modulation Schemes :

-SO basically modulation is the process of modifying the properties of waves so that it can carry our binary data.
-the raw data will be in binary format in the physical layer and we need to convert it to be carried in a radio wave to be transmitted wirelessly 
-so to do this we need modulation schemes where we will modify the properties of wave to make it carry the binary data


WORKING OF modulation schemes :

-When the data is sent through the phy layer , it will be in the binary form 
-then the phy layer decides which modulation scheme to use based on the interfernce , noise , signal strength
-for eg : the data = 1011 , we can use 4 QAM each signal (wave / symbol)can carry 2 bits per sec [10][11]
-we will be sending these through radio waves 
-the receiver will demodulate the signal to get the data back 

COMPARISON OF MODULATION SCHEMES :

1) BPSK - binary phase shift keying 
 -here 1 bit can be transfered per symbol
 - speed is very low here
 -but suited for very reliable , long distance tranfer of data
 -mainly used in 802.11 b
 
 
 2) QPSK - quadrature phase shift keying 
 -here we can send 2 bits per symbol 
 -speed is comparatively higher than BPSK 
 -it is also suitable for relaible communication 
 -used in 802.11 a/g/n/ac/ax
 
 
 3) QAM - quadrature amplitude modulation 
 
 -higher data rate which means data can be sent faster 
 -there are various schemes in this QAM
 
 16 QAM
 -4 bits can be sent per symbol
 -used in 802.11 a/g/n/ac
 
 64 QAM
 -6 bits can be sent here
 -used in 802.11 n/ac
 
 256 QAM 
 -8 bit can be sent here
 -used in 802.11 ac
 
 1024 QAM
 -10 bits can be sent here
 -used in 802.11 ax
 
 4096 QAM
 -used in 802.11 be
 -12 bits can be sent here per symbol 
 - in latest wifi , we are using this 
 -here range coverage will be very low but much faster than any other schemes
 
 
 
 WHEN TO USE WHICH SCHEME ?
 
 - if we need high thorughput we have to go for 1024 QAM , 4096QAM 
 -if signal is weak we can use BPSK , QPSK 
 
 the modulation techniques are chosen by the PHY layer dynamically  per packet .
