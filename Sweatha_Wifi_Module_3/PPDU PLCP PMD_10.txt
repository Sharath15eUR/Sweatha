PPDU , PLCP & PMD :

PPDU :
-phy  protocol data unit 
-so phy layer is the lowest layer int he stack which actaully transmits the data over the air in wireless network
-the data is sent through the packts and the entire packet of data which is sent from one device to other in wlan is called ppdu
-it has preamble , header for data rate specification and the actual data 


PLCP :
-physical layer convergence protocol
-so this layer is responsible for adding the preamble , header for the packets
-the preamble is for synchronizing the data bt sender and receiver
-and the header contains data rate and helps the receiver to know about the data rate , length etc
-it adds these things and form the ppdu

PMD :
-this is the physical medium layer used to transmit the final output of data to air 
-so we can transmit the data only as radio waves in air
-it converts the digital data to radio waves
-it chooses frequency, modulation etc fir conversion 
-and once the data is received it converts back to bits
