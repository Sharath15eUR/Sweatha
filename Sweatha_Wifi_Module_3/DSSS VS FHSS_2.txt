DSSS VS FHSS :


SPREAD SPECTRUM :
To make sure we hear the important signals in the noisy area , we use the spread spectrum techniques like DSSS OR FHSS to follow some pattern to make sure the sender and receiver can communicate with the signals in the nosiy wide network.

DSSS: 

-It spreads the signals over a wide area 
-It send the data along with a chipping code which is the random sequence generated to make the signal secure from the outsiders
-Like the chipping code will be added to our binary original data and sent to the receiver
-THe receiver will have the same chipping code to decrypt it 
-It makes the outsiders very hard to interfere and jam in the signal
-every bit in original data is multiplied with this chipping code and it will look like a noise for outsiders
-Used in wifi 802.11 b etc
-here the chipping code makes the good security

FHSS:

-Here the sender will frequently change their frequency carrier  
-they will hop from one freq to other in a pattern which is known only to the sender and reciever
-the data will be sent to one freq for a specific short time which is the dwell time and hops to the next freq 
- this will be continued so that outsiders can't track this and find the pattern
-it is very hard to jam in this type of freq spread spectrum
-Used in bluetooth etc
-here the hopping pattern makes the good security
-the receiver have to know the same freq hopping pattern to decrypt the signal
