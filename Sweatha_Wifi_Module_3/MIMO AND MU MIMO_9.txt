MIMO AND MU-MIMO :

MIMO :

-multiple input and multiple output
-here the wifi router can send multiple data at the same time through multiple antennas
-but the data is sent from one device alone 
-it increase the spped of data from one device
-for eg if we are sending a large file data means we can use this to send the data in multiple streams to speed up the sending
-used in wifi 4 

MU-MIMO :

-multi user multiple input and multiple output
-here we can send multiple data from multiple users at the same time
-more than one device's data is transmitted here
-data speed is high and also from multiple devices
-for eg when we want to download large files from laptop , phone etc at the same time
-used in wifi 5
