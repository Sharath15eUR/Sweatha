ACCESS POINTS 

-Access points are used to enable the wireless devices to connect to a wired network. 
-So it enables the communication between the wireless devices and the wired network

MAIN FUNCTIONS 

-the main purpose is it is connected to a wired LAN and it sends the signals like radio signals which the devices captures to connect it to the internet. 

-So how a device connects to the router through AP is the AP assigns unique IP address to all the devices in the network to gain them access for a router .

-APs can handle multiple devices at the same time so to ensure smooth connection between them .

-it supports that the multiple input multiple output technology to enable the connections between multiple users at the same time in the network .

-in a large network user can switch from one AP to another AP we have seen that in ESS concept in the assignments and without losing any connection we can
switch from one AP to another AP .

-we can also like log the details of AP's connected devices signal strength and with frequency etc in the log , it helps like the admin or the one who in the network administration role and can use that for any troubleshoot activities. 

-So in overall the main functionality of AP is it will be connected to a wired LAN and it expands that wired LAN to be connected to multiple number of users and multiple
number of devices to provide a seamless connection  to a Wi-Fi connection.

-through the access point we can connect to the wired LAN multiple devices multiple users can connect to the wired LAN at the same time and there
will be a reliable secured connections.
