WIFI BACKHAUL:

Backhauls are used to connect the isp modem to the access points which enable the devices to connect to the internet

TYPES :
- FIbre optic:
--it uses fibre optic cables for the data transfer
--and it provide like avery reliable connection
--ANd here the speed will be very high 
--large city , college will have this type


-Ethernet :
--it uses physical wires to connect to routers
--lesser speed than fibre optic
--it is used in offices , home , colleges

-P2P(point to point):
--Uses signals to directle connect the end to end devices
--low speed
--it can be affected by weather and can be interfered by the other signals
--rural areas where we can't make like physical cables we can use this 

-cellular:
--uses mobile n/w to provide the connection
--here reliability depends on signal strength
--for temp set up and remote conn we can use this

-satellite:
--uses satellite to provide the conn
--here data loss will be very high since the satellites are far away
--reliability can also get affected by the weather conditions
--used for discovering disasters , locate ships etc


BACKHAUL USED AT :

COLLEGE: Ethernet in labs 
--In my pov , ethernet is used because of its stable connection
--it is not interfered with any other signals
--low latency so the practical problems will be solved effectively
--it is more secure since wired one and no drops of data irrespective of distance

HOME : dsl ethernet
--MY home router conn is dsl broadband which uses copper line to give the internet
--The BSNL copper line will connect the internet with dsl modem and from which the wifi router is connected to the devices 
--ethernet is used bt the modem and router
--i found this by ifconfig -a cmd and i saw the type ethernet 
--in the whatismyip awebsite i entered my public ip and found that the n/w speed is managed through the dsl
