LAYER IN OSI MODEL for WIFI STANDARD:

Wifi (wireless n/w) works at 2 layers , one is physical layer and other one is data link layer .

PHYSICAL LAYER :

-here the digital data is sent to the physical medium as radio signals which flows through the air 
-this layer usually transmits the raw data and it controls the shared physical medium
-the conversion of digital data to wireless signals i done here
-ANd this layer also controls the speed at which the data is transmitted
-it uses orthogonal freq division multiplexing and division sequence spread spectrum to convert digital data to signals
-in overall it controls send and receive of wireless signals and the speed and distance the data goes 


DATA LINK LAYER :

-this layer helps in framing of data , flow and error control , who can access the data to avoid collision 
-it has 2 sublayers : mac and llc

MAC :Medium access control layer

-it controls who can send the data in the n/w to avoid the interference
-and it assigns the mac address which is the primary work of this layer
-it uses collision avoidance because in wireless communication we cant detect the collision since we don't know who sent the data to detect , instead we can avoid collision
-this is done by device will check for idle medium if idle it sends its data if not it waits for a random time and then again checks
-random time waiting is the key here if both device wait for same time and again check means it will be a collision 
-so we use csma here to avoid collision



LLC: Logical link control layer

-it checks the error and check for any error bits 
-it also controls the flow of data to ensure the data is sent and received in the correct sequence
-using this we can provide a smooth sending and receiving of data 



Overall , these 2 layers are used to send and receive the data fast , smooth and reliable thorugh wireless transmission in wifi .
