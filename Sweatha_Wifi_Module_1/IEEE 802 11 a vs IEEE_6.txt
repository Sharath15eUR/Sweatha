IEEE 802.11 a vs IEEE 802.11 b

802.11 a:

FREQ:5GHZ
SPEED:54 mbps ; it is faster than 802.11 b useful for video stream ,huge file download
RANGE:shorter range;high freq are blocked by walls so shorter range
INTERFERENCE:low;since 5GHZ is less crowded and not commonly used by the people
COST:very expensive ;high speed and low interrupt make it more costly
USAGE:used in large industry where high speed req


802.11 b:

FREQ:2.4GHZ
SPEED:11mbps ; slower than 802.11 a
RANGE:longer range; since it has a low freq it can be travelled to longer range
INTERFERENCE:more interfernece since it is a most common one used by people and can interfered by any otehr devices bluetooth etc..
COST:low cost and suited for home and office cost effective use
USAGE:used in home , office for better range and low cost
